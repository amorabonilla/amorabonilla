Angel Mora-Bonilla currently works at the Department of Applied Mathematics , University of Malaga. Angel does research in Logic and Foundations of Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Algebra. 

Their current projects are: 

- **Simplification Logic** for implications/functional dependencies
- Formal Concept Analysis with negative attributes: Applications.
- We have developed a R package, named ``fcaR`` that is in CRAN, and in https://github.com/neuroimaginador. 

**fcaR**: The aim of this package is to provide tools to perform fuzzy formal concept analysis (FCA) from within R. It provides functions to load and save a Formal Context, extract its concept lattice and implications. In addition, one can use the implications to compute semantic closures of fuzzy sets and, thus, build recommendation systems.
